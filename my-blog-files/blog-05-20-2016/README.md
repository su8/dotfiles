(See the in-browser **features** in action.)[https://github.com/wifiextender/wifiextender.github.io/tree/master/img/overview/README.md]

I have also edited geminiblog to:

- [x] Be always mobile compatible by using the bootstrap framework. You can easily swap themes with single mouse click in the **Theme** section.
- [x] Display Recent Posts and Categories sidebars in every page.
- [x] Set window title according to the requested page.
- [x] Include syntax highlighting while your blog posts remain written in markdown (see it in action [1](https://wifiextender.github.io/#!post=switching-from-archlinux-to-freebsd-then-gentoo) and [2](https://wifiextender.github.io/#!post=install-owncloud-with-ssl-and-nginx-in-centos--version-3-)). The highlighting script and highlighting languages are crammed and minified in single file.
- [x] Make use of resources with integrity checks.
- [x] Include in-house search form. It parses your blog post titles.
- [x] Include in-browser new post creation, post editing, adjusting the **Settings**, theme switcher.
- [x] Include log-in form.
- [x] Include in-browser file(s) submission to GitHub.

There is no need to convert your markdown posts since all the magic happens in your visitors browser whenever they visit your blog. Which means you can create and edit blog posts on the go.

Even thought I made [blogfy](https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy), I have to admit that geminiblog brings the blogging down to everyone since it requires no blog post convertion and relies only on Javascript.
