<p>I f@cking hate GNOME HELL ! Literally in the beginning of 2014, the gnome development team posted message about the "Glade" where it was clearly written that the glade and pygobject should be mainly used to create GUI programs for gnome hell, the article from softpedia: "  Glade is a standalone application, but it is mostly used to created graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for GNOME applications. "</p>

<p>PyQT looks different in KDE, XFCE and Windows, so I created 3 programs by using PyQT and was stunned how different and ugly they was looking in that framework.</p>

<img src="$img/whats_new/pyqt-pygobject.png" atl="" /><p>Dunno, I don't like the fact my programs will look different if I choose PyQT but I am sure that after that angry message from the gnome hell development team I won't choose pygobject for any of my next projects.</p>

<p>This is the GUI which I made for <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/Backup-Like-King" target="_blank">https://github.com/wifiextender/Backup-Like-King</a> , but after remembering the bloody message from the gnome devs, decided to drop the gui and go with CLI version of the program. The gui had options to encrypt the backup, prioritize hourly, dayli, weekly, monthly or custom range for the backup creation , dropbox and google drive support ( including goo.gl url shortering ).
Daemon which was running in the background if you choose to arrange more than hourly backup. FTP and SSH support. All of the visual part was shaped with CSS - nearly 500 lines of code. I admit this was one of my top beautiful programs, but my motivation wasn't at the level where I was happy to use "pygobject", so decided to save the pain for myself and live with the fact that I spend nearly 1 week to get the wanted design and throw it in the toilet.</p>

<p>The questions always is "what's next", so I'd like to learn more about "Go" language and try to create few programs for my server.
Python is and will be my primary programming language for this year, just for now I'm not really certain which GUI framework to choose.</p>

<p>These days will write ArchLinux installation guide.</p>
