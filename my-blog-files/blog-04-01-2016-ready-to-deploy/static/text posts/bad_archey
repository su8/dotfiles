<p>I dual boot from time to time. Today while upgrading my archey noticed that the upgraded GRUB did not detected my windows partiotion.</p>

<p>Rebooted the computer and what to see - only archlinux was listed...</p>

<p>To fix it, tell grub to recheck the particular drive partiotion and generate new configuration after that.</p>

<pre>$root grub-install --recheck /dev/sda</pre><br />

<pre>$root grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
