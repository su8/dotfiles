<p>** update ** Two days later the TLDs was returned to noip and my subdomain is working flawlessly.</p>

<p>My lovely 3 years old subdomain was hijacked along with 21 more subdomains from the company that I don't want to mention anymore.</p>

<p>No-ip served me pretty well all those years, even as a loyal client they sent me 3 stickers.</p>

<p>As you probably heard or not, on June 30th 2014, after the rumors that no-ip has been used by 2 botnets to damage more than 7 million personal computers by infecting them with malwares, a federal court has given permission to be seized 22 of the no-ip subdomains.</p>

<p>I don't know who is right or wrong, but I know that 3 years of my life has gone with a finger snap. I've survived hacked wordpress account, migration over different hosting providers, cms, and hand written pages. I can't take it anymore, honestly my domain name and my loyal visitors was the only thing that  kept me smiling and being creative.</p>

<p>Dunno what to say, my heart is bleeding and I'm so mad that my hands are tied.</p>
