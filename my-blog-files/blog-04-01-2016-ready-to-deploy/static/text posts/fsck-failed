title:  OpenBSD - fsck failed

<p>Replaced my CentOS DNS server with OpenBSD because this BSD derivative has a priority to be secure - all of it's code and packages are <strong>audited</strong>.</p>

<p>I like how bare bone it is, reminds of Arch and in same time the package naming is same as in CentOS.</p>

<p>OpenBSD recommends to install <strong>packages</strong> over the usage of <strong>ports</strong>, so in order to start using the <strong>pkg_*</strong> tools you should add the main ftp mirror to your root profile which will allow all system users to use the <strong>pkg_*</strong> tools.</p>

<pre>$user echo export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/`uname -r`/packages/`machine -a`/ >> ~/.profile</pre>

<p>I find it really strange that OpenBSD doesn't have a <strong>search</strong> tool (except the ports) and we are left to invent our own solutions.</p>

<p>Installed OpenBSD with 2GB of ram, and saw it is not that ram hungry as centos, so removed 3x512MB modules and left the server with only 512MB of ram.</p>

<p>And here the problem came while booting - it tried to examine the system changes and repair the system configuration, but <strong>fsck failed</strong></p>

<p>Tried to remount it as <strong>rw</strong> but it said 'device is busy'. After that spent nearly one hour in the search engines without any clue how to fix this issue.</p>

<p>Later on, a friend of mine told me to try fsck in live cd. I have a nice leather cd case and choosed the live cd with Tails.</p>

<p>When it booted, unmounted the OpenBSD partition and ran fsck to "Check for bad blocks and add them to the badblock list".</p>

<pre>$root umount /dev/sdX
<p>$root fsck -cf /dev/sdX</p></pre>

<p>Wait a while and once it's done reboot the server and have fun :}</p>
