<p>Why your computer is using fracture of your RAM when it boot up, but sooner you are running out of RAM ?</p>

<p>Actually, I would be more worried if all of my RAM wasn't used, let me explain it in details.</p>

<p>The kernel is designed to <strong>cache</strong> every single process that's tirggered at some point, so if you launched your favourite web browser and closed it after a while, instead releasing the used memory the kernel will allocate that memory as cache, so every next web browser launching will be blazing faster.</p>

<p>Long story short - there is no need to use the same computing power for process that's going to be used more than once.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean if a memory hungry program is executed it will use your swap (in case you got swap). Part of that cache will be released, so the hungry program can continue it's operation.</p>
