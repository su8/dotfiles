It took me almost a month to get the desired design. Sure at the end it was eyecandy, but managing more than 300 pages everyday became really exhausting job. In the same time my website was hosted by "free webhosting provider" - no names please, and the more famous my website became the longer the downtimes was. After two months decided to move my website in wordpress.com, the conversion was easy - less than five hours for the posts and design. I was getting enormous spam comments and there was a time when I was not able to decide does the particular comment is really spam or not.</p><p>You may ask me "but why have you leaved wordpress", will tell you that my account was compromissed somehow and I am still waiting response from the wordpress "support". Their log-in page is using SSL, so the chance someone to know my 15 characters long and complex password was so small.</p></div><br /><a href='https://wifiextender.github.io/post/blog_converted/' class='btn btn-primary btn-sm'>Read more</a><br /><br /><br /><div class=2013-07-05><a href='https://wifiextender.github.io/post/fedora-xfce-customization/'><h1>Fedora XFCE Customization - from ugly to eyecandy</h1></a><div class='articleline2'></div><p>This tutorial contains so many pictures that I decided to include them as a links, because the page was loading for 10 seconds.It's my 2nd day since I switched to Fedora from Sabayon, so this time I choose xfce instead <strong>mate</strong>.
