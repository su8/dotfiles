The python files used to generate my blog are located <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/dotfiles/tree/master/my-blog-files" target="_blank">here</a>. There isn't much difference between my configs and those found in <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy" target="_blank">Blogfy</a>.

The "Archlinux" bootstrap theme in my blog was created by me in honour of my first year as GitHub user.
