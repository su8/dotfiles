That's what it shows when the Steam client is ran from the terminal:</p><p><strong>process 32048: arguments to dbus_connection_open_private() were incorrect, assertion "address != NULL" failed in file dbus-connection.c line 2664.

Download some of the two Source Code archive links. Extract the archive, launch your terminal emulator and compile them:</p><pre><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> ./configure --prefix=/tmp --enable-sdl-dlopen --disable-arts --disable-esd --disable-nas --enable-alsa --enable-pulseaudio-shared --enable-video-wayland --disable-rpath<p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> make && make install</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> cp -r /tmp/lib/* ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Torchlight II/lib64</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(239,41,41);">#</code2> cp -r /tmp/include/SDL2 /usr/include</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(239,41,41);">#</code2> chown -R root:root /usr/include/SDL2</p></pre><p>Now I can see that the game is loading for around 5 seconds, but segfaults again. With no hints what went wrong (it just says bare bore "segmentation fault"), I knew that I have to debug the game with gdb and strace. After running the debugging programs and reading the 1000+ lines long log <strong>carefully</strong>...</p><pre>Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.<p>#0  0x00007ff9a1d510dd in Ogre::Root::addMovableObjectFactory(Ogre::MovableObjectFactory*, bool) ()</p><p>from /home/frost/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Torchlight II/lib64/libOgreMain.so.1</p></pre><p>The shared library libOgreMain.so.1 crashed because I had no <strong>ogre</strong> 3D engine installed, and it wasn't mentioned anywhere that I have to have ogre installed. Your distro may provide a package for this engine, if not compile it yourself.</p><p>Played the first Torchlight release many times through the years and only the good memories about it kept me in the waiting list for the second game and it's native port.</p> </div></div></div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Popular Tags</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><div id="popular_tagz"></div></div></div> <div class="list-group"><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Recent Posts</h3></div><div id="recent_poztz"></div></div></div>  </div> </div> <footer> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-12"> Powered by <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="showOS();">OS test</a> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="../../css/js/scr.js" async></script>  </body> </html>
