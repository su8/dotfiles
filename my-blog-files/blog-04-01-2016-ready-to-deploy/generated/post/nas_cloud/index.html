Have both.</h1><div class="date-left"><span class="label label-default">2016-03-30 Author: Aaron</span></div><div class="articleline2"></div><br /><br /><p>So you've read or watched some video regarding home NAS or cloud solution and want to give it a try.</p><p>After all your privacy matters more than your pride, and Google doesn't cut the mustard.</p><p>You have to define what's the purpose of this home NAS/cloud.</p><p>Are you going to cram all of your smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktop pc files in this NAS/cloud and rely on it as long-term backup station ? If so, how often are you going to access those files ? Do you have redundant storage of those files or raid mirroring ? Are you prepared for power outages, drive failure, sacrifice your home space where the device will reside ? What happens next if someone is able to steal this device while you are not at home ? Have you considered the yearly impact on your electricity bill (300 watt server under full system load / 1000 + 24 * cost per kWh * 365) == $524 if [[ "${cost_per_kWh}" == "20cent" ]]; then per_month="$43" fi ?</p><p>The above one was just single example, you have to plan wisely and find out why you need this home NAS/cloud yourself. Also the simple and smaller your requirments are, the easier will be for you to mitigate any issues.</p><p>Nowadays the online storage comes at no cost up to <strong>some</strong> cost, depending on your needs.</p><p>What follows next is that I am going to show you how to have long-term backup NAS and cloud for free, the catch is that you'll have to rely on online <a href="https://owncloud.org/providers/" taget="_blank">owncloud provider</a>. This way you'll eliminate all the hassle listed in the above example, but still be able to control your cloud the way you want to.</p><p>I've chosen the blaucloud provider for this blog post, if your storage needs require more than 2GB, please be my guest and pick other provider with more space.</p><p>The administration page is great, it shows me that by default the server-side encryption plugin is enabled and I can enable/disable several more (up to 10) plugins, that's out-of-the-box.</p><p>The interesting part is that you can attach other online storage provider, you'll find more in "external storage" section.</p><p>After spending some time in your owncloud, it is pretty much inavoidable to notice the word <strong>WebDAV</strong>. Head over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> to learn what WebDAV is.</p><p>So let's get started. Install <strong>davfs2</strong>. After that add your $USER to the davfs2 group:</p><pre><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(239,41,41);">#</code2> gpasswd -a YOUR_USER davfs2<p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> groups YOUR_USER</p></pre><p>It is good idea to avoid using system wide davfs2 configuration. Create the davfs2 folder where you'll store the configuration file and SSL certificate.</p><pre><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> mkdir -p --mode=700 ~/.davfs2<p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(239,41,41);">#</code2> cp -r /etc/davfs2/{secrets,davfs2.conf} ~/.davfs2</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(239,41,41);">#</code2> chown YOUR_SYSTEM_USER:YOUR_SYSTEM_USER ~/.davfs2/{secrets,davfs2.conf}</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> chmod 600 ~/.davfs2/{secrets,davfs2.conf}</p></pre><p>Append your owncloud provider webdav page followed by your account and password in <strong>~/.davfs2/secrets</strong>.</p><pre>https://YOUR_ACCOUNT.blaucloud.de/remote.php/webdav/ YOUR_ACCOUNT YOUR_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD</pre><p>Create a directory where the SSL certificate will reside, after that download the certificate, then tell <strong>davfs2.conf</strong> where the certificate resides.</p><pre><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> mkdir -p --mode=700 ~/.davfs2/certs<p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> openssl s_client -connect YOUR_ACCOUNT.blaucloud.de:443 -showcerts &lt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM > ~/.davfs2/certs/cert.pem</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> chmod 600 ~/.davfs2/certs/cert.pem</p><p># Uncomment trust_server_cert and point the location of cert.pem</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> sed -i 's|# trust_server_cert|trust_server_cert ~/.davfs2/certs/cert.pem|g' ~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</p></pre><p>In order your "NAS" to be network attached, it have to be mounted. Now you'll have to edit your <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> and specify the mount point location.</p><pre>https://YOUR_ACCOUNT.blaucloud.de/remote.php/webdav/ /media/NAS_cloud davfs user,rw,noauto,file_mode=600,dir_mode=700 0 0</pre><p>Now create this directory and set some permissions:</p><pre><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(239,41,41);">#</code2> mkdir -p --mode=700 /media/NAS_cloud<p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(239,41,41);">#</code2> chown YOUR_SYSTEM_USER:YOUR_SYSTEM_USER /media/NAS_cloud</p></pre><p>Open up your file manager and you'll see the NAS_cloud mount point, click on it and you are ready to rock.</p><p>No matter what solution you choose, don't store your files without some sort of encryption.</p><p>I was huge LUKS fan, but since my very last blog post I went working and travelling across many European countries carrying only my smartphone me, and then my LUKS passion started to chill. I ended up writing <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/skilcrypt" target="_blank">skilcrypt</a>, basically EncFS utilizing GPG instead.</p><p>Came to the conclusion that the rusty GPG fellow is cross platform, water err tamperproof, doesn't require pre-allocated space in first place. Wrote 3 skilcrypt scripts, two of which are trying to mimic EncFS as much as possible, while remaining smartphone friendly (no filename mangling, avoiding to "move the problem" citing EncFS configuration file).</p> </div></div></div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Popular Tags</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><div id="popular_tagz"></div></div></div> <div class="list-group"><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Recent Posts</h3></div><div id="recent_poztz"></div></div></div>  </div> </div> <footer> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-12"> Powered by <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="showOS();">OS test</a> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="../../css/js/scr.js" async></script>  </body> </html>
