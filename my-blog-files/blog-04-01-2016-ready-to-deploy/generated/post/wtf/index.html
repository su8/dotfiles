I've survived hacked wordpress account, migration over different hosting providers, cms, and hand written pages. I can't take it anymore, honestly my domain name and my loyal visitors was the only thing that  kept me smiling and being creative.</p><p>Dunno what to say, my heart is bleeding and I'm so mad that my hands are tied.</p><img src="https://wifiextender.github.io/img/file/website_down/my_website_down.png" alt="" /><br /><img src="https://wifiextender.github.io/img/file/website_down/my_website_down1.png" alt="" /><br /><img src="https://wifiextender.github.io/img/file/website_down/my_website_down2.png" alt="" /><br /> </div></div></div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Popular Tags</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><div id="popular_tagz"></div></div></div> <div class="list-group"><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Recent Posts</h3></div><div id="recent_poztz"></div></div></div>  </div> </div> <footer> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-12"> Powered by <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="showOS();">OS test</a> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="../../css/js/scr.js" async></script>  </body> </html>
