The solution is called file splitting. We got the data and will split it on several chunks, so we can write the chunks onto several Blu ray discs or upload them to the cloud flawlessly.</p><p>Let's produce a dummy file and demonstrate how to split it. Type <code>dd if=/dev/zero of=aa.iso count=10MB</code> , this will produce roughly 5GB file named <strong>aa.iso</strong></p><p>You can split <strong>aa.iso</strong> and compress it's chunks in the same time. <strong>lz4</strong> provides outstanding compression speed by no means. Here is the splitting command itself:</p><pre><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> split --bytes=500M --additional-suffix=.chunk --filter='lz4 > $FILE.lz4' aa.iso </pre><p>Adjust the <strong>--bytes</strong> value according to your needs, the higher value the lesser chunk files and vice versa.</p><p>The command produced 10 compressed chunks in our case. Don't even think to use file-manager to extract the chunks.</p><p>To restore the original file type <code>cat *.chunk.lz4 | lz4 -d > aa2.iso</code>.</p><p>It is highly recommended to include simple text file and explain what you've done and how to achieve the wanted result back, so you don't have to scratch your head after a year or two when you decide to restore the file(s).</p><p>Make sure that the produced chunks will reside in their own folder along with the simple text file.</p><p>As promised at the beginning of this post, we will capture and replay our interactive shell session. I have to <strong>YELL</strong> you that everything you are about to type will be executed in same order, timing and pauses, so don't perform any "remove" or "install" commands during the <strong>capturing</strong>.</p><p>Take it seriously because it's that easy to fuck up your system if you type something silly.</p><p>Invoke the command <code>script --timing 2> capture_begin</code> and you'll get response like <strong>Script started, file is typescript</strong></p><p>From now on everything is recorded and appended to the files capture_begin, typescript.</p><p>Invoke some <strong>SAFE</strong> and random commands:</p><pre><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> echo 'Hot + dog = woof woof burger' | xz -9e > shizzle_my_nizzle.xz<p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> date</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> printf "%s" $SHELL</p><p><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> whoami</p></pre><p>Once done press CTRL-D to stop the capturing. To replay it type <code>scriptreplay capture_begin</code> sit back, watch and laugh.</p><p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year in advance.</p> </div></div></div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Popular Tags</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><div id="popular_tagz"></div></div></div> <div class="list-group"><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Recent Posts</h3></div><div id="recent_poztz"></div></div></div>  </div> </div> <footer> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-12"> Powered by <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="showOS();">OS test</a> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="../../css/js/scr.js" async></script>  </body> </html>
