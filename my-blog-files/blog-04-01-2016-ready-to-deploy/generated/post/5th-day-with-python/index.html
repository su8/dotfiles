The book that I am reading these days is called "Python For Dummies". I get bored from some time and need to distract myself. Found out that Google has made a Python video classes and I am watching at least 1 video per a day.</p><p> Today I am so proud from myself, you might notice that my blog is having 4 pages - main page, archive page, forum page and error 404 page. Hm, since I created that forum page it does not get the content automatically updated, so the main and archive pages are updated automatically why do I have to add all the new content manually when I can try to edit build.py and adjust it to sync my forum page ? It sounds easy for someone that is familiar with Python, but for a newbie like me it sounds like a rocket science.</p><h2>Ninja IDE</h2>Nonetheless 3 days ago I downloaded an Python IDE called Ninja IDE and fixed a python script with zero knowledge over python with this ide, thankfully to pep8 errors that are displayed in real time. Must admit that I learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript in recent years.<p>I made few comments in the blogpy developer page, where I pointed few things which has to be corrected. Visiting the same website today I found out that he deleted my comments, but he fixed these things that I pointed.</p><p>I will not judge him for that, but from now on will post these contributions to MY website and then linking them as a comment there.</p><h2>The code</h2><p>For my forum page I use forum_build.py, which is copied & modified version of build.py - both files are stored in the same folder. If I want to update the posts for the forum page I do this:</p><pre><code2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(42,159,214);">$</code2> python2 forum_build.py</pre><img src="https://wifiextender.github.io/img/file/fifth_day/forum_build.py.png" alt="" /><br /><a href="https://wifiextender.github.io/img/file/fifth_day/footer_forum.png">footer_forum</a> , <a href="https://wifiextender.github.io/img/file/fifth_day/header_forum.png">header_forum</a> </div></div></div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Popular Tags</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><div id="popular_tagz"></div></div></div> <div class="list-group"><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Recent Posts</h3></div><div id="recent_poztz"></div></div></div>  </div> </div> <footer> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-12"> Powered by <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="showOS();">OS test</a> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="../../css/js/scr.js" async></script>  </body> </html>
