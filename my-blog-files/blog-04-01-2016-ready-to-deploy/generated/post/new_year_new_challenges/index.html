Well it's pretty simple, many folks that are using Windows or Macintosh will migrate to GNU/Linux and will have to use the SteamOS. During the beta is the right time for you to start learning some programming or scripting language, so you can help on those people that have no knowledge how to achieve something without searching for it in the search engines, this way your name will be mentioned.</p><p>Start with bash. Purchase that book - Learning the bash Shell: Unix Shell Programming In a Nutshell. Read it for less than a month, then once you feel more mature, go to <a href="http://en.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html" target="_blank">http://en.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html</a></p><p>It will take you up to 2 months to master tha basics of the bash. Next comes the Python. You will have to purchase some books again: Python For Dummies, Programming in Python 3 2nd Edition, and the free boook - <a href="http://www.diveintopython3.net/" target="_blank">http://www.diveintopython3.net/</a>. The book " programming in python3 " is the one that will take the most of your time since it's nearly 650 pages long. It's long way to go till you understand everything, but the most important thing is to repeat what you just learned. I read those books for exactly 4 months, while creating programs. Once you understand the basics of python, I recommend you to refresh the already learned information by completing the challenge series at <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/" target="_blank">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/</a> and read that book - <a href="http://files.swaroopch.com/python/byte_of_python.pdf" target="_blank">http://files.swaroopch.com/python/byte_of_python.pdf</a></p><p>Basically, you don't need to know so much python as you might think to start programming and create really USEFUL programs. I recommend you to fork already existing project and try improving it, doing this will expand your knowledge and won't require from you to read more books in order to understand how that thing worked out. The most important thing is not to give up when you stuck, but ask someone else. Here comes stackoverflow. Another useful reference is for the modules usage, when you have no idea what the particular module behaviour is, then take a look by calling "epydoc modulename" in your terminal. epydoc - A tool for generating API documentation for Python modules, based on their docstrings.</p><p>Create some CLI programs, after a while move to GUI programming. Be careful while choosing the right GUI toolkit. Don't even think about mastering the ugly Tk ! PyQT/PySide and PyGObject(PyGTK+3) are the most used, both have designers which will help you to create the wanted application design without spending even a minute coding it manually. PyQT is the most customizable and powerful, but finding information and that information to match your pyqt version is the thing that may stop you from using it, on the other hand PyGObject is the most easy to understand and use, but it struggles from enormous bugs.</p><p>Create few GUI programs by coding them manually, after that learn and start using Glade and/or Qt Designer for more complex programs.</p><p>Believe me, if your programs are really USEFUl they won't remain unused. Many GNU/Linux websites are writing tutorials and serve daily information about the latest software and technologies, so your chances are really higher your programs to become popular.</p><p>As for me, I will have to move in a bigger town since there is no chance for me finding a job in this stupid village. I just cannot live anymore working 1 or 2 days in a week and getting paid lower and being worried about my unknown future. One thing is sure, I won't stop programming nor learning new languages.</p> </div></div></div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Popular Tags</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><div id="popular_tagz"></div></div></div> <div class="list-group"><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Recent Posts</h3></div><div id="recent_poztz"></div></div></div>  </div> </div> <footer> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-12"> Powered by <a href="https://github.com/wifiextender/blogfy" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="javascript: void(0);" onclick="showOS();">OS test</a> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="../../css/js/scr.js" async></script>  </body> </html>
