I managed to get a full day work, got a dog (black jack russel terrier), learned more python, fixed some issues with my project and added new things in it also made it working in two different versions of python.</p><p>There is no time even to publish some tutorial, recently had a little issue with the display managers, so will tell you that it's better to install few display managers, just in case some of them freak out. My stable xfce display manager  - lxdm freaked out once I installed plymouth and thankfully to lynx I found out about the mdm and slim - display managers.</p><p>Arch xfce with mdm on legacy radeon isn't the best combination so at the end I started using slim with this theme <a href="http://alienatedhumour.deviantart.com/art/Elegant-Brit-SLiM-317321395" target="_blank">http://alienatedhumour.deviantart.com/art/Elegant-Brit-SLiM-317321395</a></p><p>So whenever you install some distro, be prepared with lynx installed plus a couple of display managers and alternative to your network manager - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager</a></p><p>Found out how to manage my router without using it's gateway ip. I'm command line guy and I can telnet into my router via simple terminal and few (thousand) commands. A nice website called http://npr.me.uk/telnet.html has a collection of almost any telnet command that my router is capable of, and I wanted to have some application that will be able to store this information without the need to open up my browser (just in case I don't have internet or my nic is down) and call that page.</p><p>The same day when I wanted to create that application I knew that it needs to be a python based, so went in youtube and did a quick query and found something about "Manjaro" - the video was recorded by someone named Sparty. The Manjaro welcome application really impressed me and once I finished watching this video started to download latest manjaro distribution. Once downloaded, fired up the virtualbox and copied this app and in less than 3 hours I based the desired project that was in my head earlier this day on/to this manjaro welcome application.
