<p>Just found out that DNSCrypt can be used without OpenDNS.</p>

<p>Let's dive into the DNS encryption configuration.</p>

<p>In <strong>/etc/resolv-dnsmasq.conf</strong> add:</p>

<pre>$root nameserver 127.0.0.2</pre>

<p>Open up <strong>/etc/dnsmasq.conf</strong> and append:</p>

<pre>$root resolv-file=/etc/resolv-dnsmasq.conf</pre>

<p>Install <code>libsodium</code>.</p>

<p>Now <a href="http://download.dnscrypt.org/dnscrypt-proxy/" target="_blank">download</a> the latest DNSCrypt version, extract the archive with <code>tar -vxf dns*</code>, <strong>cd</strong> into the newly created folder, compile and install it with:</p>

<pre>$user ./configure --prefix=/usr
<p>$user make</p>
<p>$root sudo make install</p></pre>

<p>Go to the opennicproject DNSCrypt <a href="http://meo.ws/dnsrec.php" target="_blank">page</a> and choose the server that is closer to your country - it should be the same IP that is present in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. I'll use some random one. Now start the dnscrypt program with the selected server:</p>

<pre>$root dnscrypt-proxy --provider-key=1F92:37B2:4083:D058:E871:615B:59C7:3E28:EC54:FC4E:231D:017B:DA02:A532:6AF2:72BE --provider-name=2.fvz-rec-de-dus-01.dnscrypt-cert.meo.ws --resolver-address=62.141.38.230:443 --local-address=127.0.0.2:53 --user=nobody --daemonize</pre>

<p>127.0.0.<strong>1</strong> is used by dnsmasq while 127.0.0.<strong>2</strong> will be used by DNSCrypt, so make sure to type 2 and not 1.</p>

<p>My ISP is intentionally slowing all of the arch mirrors (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mirrors#List_by_speed" target="_blank">despite my attempts</a>) whenever I try to upgrade my system. I never would have thought that dnscrypt would bypass bandwidth throttling, but it did; viva dnscrypt !</p>

<p>Now I know that my ISP is filtering the packets and has some pattern matching algorithms. At least I have clue, so a couple levels of OpenBSD firewalls and Tor routers will be installed right now. Tor router -> OpenBSD firewall -> Tor Bundle on every personal computer at home. I'll have to buy another 16 port switch and 12 NICs. My whole weekend will be true madness.</p>
