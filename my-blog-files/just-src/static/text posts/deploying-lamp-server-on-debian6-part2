title:  Deploying LAMP server on Debian 6 part 2

<p>In this second part of our Debian lamp deployed server, we will&nbsp;discuss how to hide what kind of HTTP server we are running on and later will learn how to change our internal ip. The very first thing that you will need to edit in order to hide the http server signature ( &nbsp;<em>Apache/2.2.16 (Debian) Server</em>&nbsp;)</p>

<pre>$root nano /etc/apache2/conf.d/security</pre>

<p>Press <strong>CTRL+W</strong> to find the following string:</p>

<pre>ServerTokens</pre>

<p>Where you change it from <em>OS</em> to <em>Prod</em>, so it have to look like this:</p>

<pre>ServerTokens Prod</pre>

<p><b>Navigate</b>&nbsp;few rows below that string in the same file and edit: ServerSignature</p>

<p>The default ServerSignature will be: <em>ServerSignature On</em>, you have to change it to:</p>

<pre>ServerSignature Off</pre>

<p>Almost done with that, just restart the apache.</p>

<pre>service apache2 restart</pre>

<p>Let's find now how to change the internal ip of the server, before to begin make sure that you know how do you obtain that internal ip, via your ISP router/gateway or from your home router - it's important to know that.</p>

<p>I want you to type that command</p>

<pre>$user ifconfig</pre>

<p>Do you see eth0 or eth1 or wlan0 or wlan1 ? Notice which name has obtained your network adapter and adjust it in the configuration file that we will edit.</p>

<pre>$root nano /etc/network/interfaces</pre>

<p>The default file should look like this one:</p>

<pre>auto lo
<p>iface lo inet loopback</p>
<p>auto eth0</p>
<p>iface eth0 inet dhcp</p></pre>

<p>I assume that you have a router in your home, so let's change the eth0 interfaces and set static internal ip</p>

<pre>auto eth0
<p>iface eth0 inet static</p>
<p>address 192.168.11.100</p>
<p>netmask 255.255.255.0</p>
<p>gateway 192.168.11.1</p></pre>

<p>In the second row you changed dhcp to static in order to tell your router that this device (your server) do not want to lease the particular internal ip after a while. The third row points which internal ip do you want, it should be in the range of 1-254, it cannot end with 192.168.11.571 - as I said it should be in the range of 1-254. XXX-XXX-XXX-1 to XXX-XXX-XXX-254, where XXX stands for the assigned numbers for your internal ip.
For the fourth row I will redirect you to read more about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netmask" target="_blank">here</a>. The last row stands for entry point of your/or your ISP router - please note that this ip should NOT NOT NOT be changed, unless you own managed router and understand how networking works. Most of the cheap routers (below 200$) are unmanaged, so as I said you should NOT change the gateway address.</p>

<p>Restart the network via:</p>

<pre>$root /etc/init.d/networking restart</pre>

<p>That was it, it was simple right :&#41;</p>
